"""vLLM client that exposes the wire shape pddl_eval.chat consumes.

The harness in pddl_eval/{chat,runner,scoring}.py reads response dicts with
dict-form tool_call arguments, message.thinking, and top-level
prompt_eval_count / eval_count / done_reason / total_duration. vLLM speaks
OpenAI's chat-completions shape (string-form tool_call arguments,
finish_reason, usage.prompt_tokens, optional reasoning_content). This module
adapts the wire formats so the existing chat loop works unchanged.

Historical: the field names (prompt_eval_count, done_reason, …) are
inherited from the Ollama backend that was retired in 2026-05; they are the
internal contract chat.py was built around, kept stable for corpus
comparability.

Wire-format adaptations:
  * tool_calls[].function.arguments: JSON string  ↔  dict
  * message.reasoning_content (--reasoning-parser qwen3) → message.thinking
  * choice.finish_reason → done_reason ("stop" / "length" / "tool_calls")
  * usage.{prompt,completion}_tokens → prompt_eval_count / eval_count
  * total_duration / eval_duration synthesised from wallclock perf_counter
  * Multi-turn tool replay: assistant tool_calls get synthetic call_ids, then
    consecutive role=tool messages reuse them in FIFO order so vLLM's
    OpenAI server accepts the multi-turn replay.

Knobs translated:
  * options.temperature       → temperature
  * options.num_predict       → max_tokens
  * options.num_ctx           → ignored (server-side via --max-model-len)
  * keep_alive                → ignored (server-side via TTL or none)
  * think (qwen3 thinking)    → extra_body.chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking
  * format=<schema dict>      → extra_body.guided_json
  * format="json"             → response_format={"type": "json_object"}

Streaming is forced off — tracks vLLM/Qwen3 hermes streaming bug
vllm-project/vllm#31871 (May 2026) where partial tool_call XML can be
mis-extracted on token boundaries. The harness never reads streamed deltas
either, so non-streaming is the safe default.

Context-overflow handling: vLLM rejects prompt_tokens + max_tokens >
max_model_len with HTTP 400 BadRequestError. chat() catches the specific
overflow body, clips max_tokens to the remaining budget, and retries.
The degenerate prompt ≥ max_model_len case returns a synthetic
length-truncation response with empty content (see
`_synthesize_overflow_response`), preserving the existing chat.py
classifier for `done_reason="length"` truncation.

# Match vLLM's context-overflow rejection so we can retry with a clipped
# max_tokens instead of bubbling a BadRequestError up as an `exception`
# trial. Two body shapes observed in the wild:
#   Old (pre-mid-2026):
#     "prompt contains at least 8193 input tokens"
#   New (current vLLM):
#     "your prompt contains 407867 characters (more than 317440 characters,
#      which is the upper bound for 10240 input tokens)"
# Group 1 = max_model_len; group 2 = prompt_tokens reported by the server.
#
# Drift history (PR-#66 contamfix, 2026-05-20):
#   * The single-quantifier regex `prompt contains at least N` silently
#     missed the new format. Every overflow bubbled up as `FR_EXCEPTION`
#     with `tokens={}` instead of being retry-clipped or synthesized as a
#     length-truncated response. The audit found 24 600 such rows across
#     the corpus. The `(?:at least|upper bound for)` alternation below
#     matches both shapes; regression test in tests/test_vllm_client.py.

# Slack between (max_model_len − prompt_tokens) and the clipped max_tokens
# we re-send. vLLM's 400 error body reports prompt-token count as a LOWER
# bound — "your prompt contains at least N input tokens" — because the
# pre-flight check fires before final template additions (generation
# prefix, BOS, prefix-caching block-padding) are appended. The real
# served prompt is consistently higher than the reported N.
#
# Drift history (attempt-1 reported prompt → attempt-2 reported prompt):
#   * 17478753 sweep (sweep-3, qwen3.6:27b + Qwen3.5:0.8B, v0/v1/v2
#     prompts): exact and consistent +9 over 374 failures. safety = 32
#     absorbed this with ~3× headroom.
#   * sweep4-cluster-20260519 (Qwen3.5 4B/9B + v5/v6/v7 prompts under
#     the new prompt variants): drift jumped to +33 (8193 → 8226 on
#     solve, 10241 → 10274 on validate-style), so safety = 32 was off
#     by exactly +1 and every retry 400'd. ~7,400 trials (up to 31% on
#     Qwen3.5-4B off tools_all) landed as `failure_reason=exception`
#     with empty content rather than Ollama-parity `done_reason=length`.
#
# Defense is now layered:
#   1. safety = 128 absorbs the observed +33 with ~4× headroom for the
#      next prompt-template change. Output-budget cost is 96/8192 ≈ 1.2%
#      on solve, ~0.5% on smaller `num_predict` tasks.
#   2. The chat() retry path also retries a SECOND time (see MAX_RETRIES)
#      using whatever prompt-token count the previous error reported, so
#      a drift larger than safety still converges instead of bubbling a
#      BadRequestError. After max retries, falls through to
#      _synthesize_overflow_response to keep Ollama parity (done_reason
#      = "length", empty content) rather than raising.
_CTX_RETRY_SAFETY = 128
# Max number of clip-and-retry attempts AFTER the initial request. Two
# retries cover any drift smaller than ~3 × safety; bigger drifts fall
# through to the synthetic length-truncation response.
